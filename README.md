# NoMoreLonelyTerps

## Overview
The social changes occurring as a result of COVID-19 have inspired me to try and develop a simple social network that Terps can use to find and interact with other terps!. Two major factors have pushed me to start this project.

### 1) Posts I constantly see on Reddit or Twitter
Every time I open r/UMD or twitter I always see multiple posts about loneliness, depression or requests to hangout or game together.

### 2) My Brother's Freshman Year vs My Freshman Year  
My Brother is currently a Freshman in College and he has been at Home for the entirety of the semester. He has not made any new friends and he has no one to hang out with besides other people from his high school that decided to stay at home. When I was a Freshman I was lucky enough to live in the Dorms at UMD and during that year, it is safe to say that I've established life long friendships and connections with people I have never met before. This blaring disparity between my experiences and my brother's is hard to just sit back and watch. I thought this was the time to try to do something about it and here we are.

# ToDo
## 1. Create Friends and friendships
I need to create a graph like structure where the nodes are Users and the edges are friendships

## 2. Friends posts
Add Users' Friends' posts to Users' feeds along with the Users' posts

## 3. Chat
I aim to add a direct messaging feature along with general chatrooms that a User can create or enter

# So Far:

## Initial page if user is not logged in:
